# Clowny_Dice
Hi/Low, 2 person dice game involving basic javascript.

I personalized a template from the London App Brewery and made it more interesting. 

Instead of the gameplay involving using the refresh button, I connected the dice-roll function to a button on the homepage. 

This is my first foray into javascript coding and functions.

All art made by yours truly. Steal or destroy at will.
